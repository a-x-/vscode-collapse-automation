# Collapse Automation - VS Code Extension

Smart code folding for VS Code that automatically collapses logger calls and code blocks based on configurable patterns.

## Features

### üéØ Smart Function Call Detection
- Uses AST parsing to accurately detect function calls (not just string matches)
- Automatically folds multi-line function calls like `logger.info()`, `console.log()`, etc.
- Single-line calls are ignored since they can't be folded

### üîÑ Intelligent Folding
- Immediate analysis when switching files (no delay)
- Respects user preferences - won't re-fold functions you manually unfold
- Tracks when you manually fold/unfold functions
- Preserves cursor position during folding operations

### üõ†Ô∏è Flexible Configuration
- **alwaysFold**: Patterns for function calls to always fold (e.g., `["logger.info", "console.log"]`)
- **neverFold**: Patterns that should never be folded when using `@collapse` pragma
- **@collapse pragma**: Add `// @collapse` to any file to fold all code blocks

### üìù Supported Languages
- JavaScript (`.js`)
- TypeScript (`.ts`)
- JSX (`.jsx`)
- TSX (`.tsx`)

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `collapse-automation.alwaysFold`: Array of function call patterns to always fold

* `collapse-automation.collapseLevel`: Folding level for `@collapse` pragma (default: 1)

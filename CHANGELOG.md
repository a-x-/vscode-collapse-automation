# Changelog

All notable changes to the "collapse-automation" extension will be documented in this file.

## [0.0.34] - 2025-01-03

üêõ Fixed:

- Fixed cursor jumping issue when folding code - now uses `selectionLines` parameter to fold without changing cursor position
- Cursor position and multiple selections are now preserved during all folding operations
- Removed unnecessary cursor position save/restore code since we no longer change selections

üßΩ Chore:

- Reorganized test structure:
  - Renamed `simple.test.ts` to `unit.test.ts`
  - Renamed `extension.test.ts` to `bdd.test.ts`
- Added comprehensive unit tests for cursor position preservation
- Improved folding performance by batching fold operations

## [0.0.33] - 2025-01-03

‚ú® Added:

- Default patterns for common logging functions in `alwaysFold` configuration:
  - Logger patterns: `logger.info`, `logger.warn`, `logger.error`, `logger.debug`, `logger.trace`, `logger.fatal`
  - Console patterns: `console.log`, `console.warn`, `console.error`, `console.debug`, `console.trace`, `console.info`
- Users no longer need to manually configure common logging patterns

üßΩ Chore:

- Split `bump-version.js` into two separate scripts for better workflow control:
  - `bump-version.js` - Updates version in package.json
  - `create-tag.js` - Creates git tag based on current version
- Updated README.md to show new default configuration values
- Updated tests to work with new default patterns

## [0.0.32] - 2025-01-03
